# Personal Site

This is my personal website, blog, and playground. You can view it here: [https://justinjuno.dev](https://justinjuno.dev).

It was bootstrapped with Gatsby, styled with Styled Components, and uses ESLint for keeping code tidy. The blog and playground are powered by MDX. It is hosted on Netlify and uses Fathom for analytics.
